Recapitulation of Python.
a) Write a program to demonstrate working with tuples in python
Create an empty Tuple in Python
my_tuple = (); here the variable named my_tuple is the name of the tuple.
Create a Tuple with Items in Python
my_tuple = ("me", "my friend", "my brother", "my
sister");or
tuple1 = ("python", "tuple", 1952, 2323, 432);
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
tuple3 = ("a", "b", "c", "d",
"e");ex:
# Python Tuple Example
print("Creating an empty
tuple...");my_tuple = ();
print("An empty tuple, my_tuple is created
successfully.");if not my_tuple:
print("The tuple, my_tuple, contains no any
item.");print("Inserting some items to the tuple...");
my_tuple = ("me", "my friend", "my brother", "my
sister");print("\nPrinting the tuple...");
print(my_tuple);
print("\nNow printing each item in the
tuple...");for item_in_tuple in my_tuple:
print(item_in_tuple);
